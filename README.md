# TIAM62AITrafficLight

AI traffic lights with Texas Instruments AM62A and Edge Impulse.

A model is trained to recognize motorcycle riders with and without helmets. That model is loaded into TI AM62A. A regular webcam will send pictures for local inference. Inference values will be sent to a server.

A separate WiFi device - Unihiker with Debian/Python - will query the server to determine if red traffic light will switch to green.
